Adwords Status Management 
====


GOAL:

This script enables you to detect active landing pages which have no products, so that you can pause these campaigns and avoid money loss.

VALUE ADDED:

It presents what I called reverse status management, where its not based on your product feed, but on the actual information on your webite.
Adwords doesnt come with built-in possibility to advertise only on products you have in stock and pause adgroups which deeplink to landing pages with no products.

TARGET GROUP:

Small - medium companies who want to advertise on their dynamic inventory and pause their adwords campaign in time.
Companies without a product feed, or not using PPC automation software enabling them to connect their Adwords Account to the feed.

LIMITATIONS:

The script is fitting best accounts with a couple of hundred landing pages. Scraping thousands of them takes too long time.
